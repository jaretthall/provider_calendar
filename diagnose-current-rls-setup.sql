üìä DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE!

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THE RESULTS:

1. RLS POLICIES: 
   - Do you see policies requiring auth.uid()?
   - Are there multiple conflicting policies per table?
   - Do policies allow anonymous access?

2. ANONYMOUS ACCESS TEST:
   - Can you read data without authentication?
   - Are some tables accessible and others not?

3. AUTH CONTEXT:
   - What role is currently active?
   - Is auth.uid() NULL (anonymous) or set?

4. CONFLICTS:
   - Are there multiple policies causing conflicts?

5. PS SHIFT DATA:
   - Do you see your PS shift in the database?
   - When was it created vs when you tried to create it again?

Based on these results, we can determine if authentication 
is actually required or if there are other issues.
