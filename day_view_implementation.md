## Technical Architecture

### Time Slot System
```typescript
const TIME_SLOTS = [
  '06:00', '07:00', '08:00', '09:00', '10:00', '11:00',
  '12:00', '13:00', '14:00', '15:00', '16:00', '17:00',
  '18:00', '19:00', '20:00', '21:00', '22:00'
];
```

### Shift Positioning Logic
- Shifts are positioned in time slots based on their `startTime` and `endTime`
- A shift spanning multiple hours appears in all relevant time slots
- Time format conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour for display

### Integration Points
- **App.tsx:** Main calendar rendering logic updated
- **Header.tsx:** View mode buttons updated
- **SettingsForm.tsx:** Default view options updated
- **Types system:** Already supported `'day'` as CalendarViewMode

## User Experience

### Admin Users

- Can drag providers from sidebar onto specific time slots
- Can drag existing shifts to different days
- Full CRUD operations on shifts within day view

### Regular Users
