## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Configuration

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://yourproject.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Configure the Static Viewer

1. Open `static-viewer.html` in a text editor
2. Find these lines around line 75:
   ```javascript
   // Supabase Configuration - REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL VALUES
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key-here';
   ```

3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:
   ```javascript
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://yourproject.supabase.co';
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...';
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Viewer

2. **Expected Result:** You should see:
   - Loading spinner initially
   - Calendar with your schedule data
