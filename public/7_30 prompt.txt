  Senda Behavioral Health Dashboard - Development Continuation

  Current Status & Context

  You are continuing development of a Next.js 14 behavioral health dashboard application. The previous session successfully implemented a comprehensive Crisis Management System but encountered Next.js
  development server issues that need resolution.

  Project Overview

  Application: Senda Behavioral Health Dashboard
  Framework: Next.js 14.2.30 with App Router
  Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  Authentication: NextAuth.js
  Styling: Tailwind CSS
  Language: TypeScript

  Current Issue - PRIORITY #1

  The Next.js development server is not serving properly:
  - Returns 500 Internal Server Error for main page
  - JavaScript chunks (main-app.js, app-pages-internals.js) return 404 errors
  - Server appears to start but doesn't actually serve requests
  - Node.js version 18.19.1 (deprecated for Supabase client - should upgrade to Node 20+)

  Files Modified for Troubleshooting:
  - src/app/page.tsx - Simplified to minimal version
  - src/app/layout.tsx - Simplified to minimal version
  - Created src/app/test/page.tsx - Basic test page

  Next Steps for Server Fix:
  1. Investigate Node.js version compatibility issues
  2. Check for TypeScript compilation errors blocking server startup
  3. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
  4. Consider clearing node_modules and reinstalling
  5. Check for port conflicts or WSL-specific issues

  );

  ALTER TABLE crisis_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for service role" ON crisis_events FOR ALL USING (true);

  Project Architecture

  Key Directories:
  - src/app/ - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - src/components/ - Reusable React components
  - src/lib/ - Utility functions, database connections, services
  - src/providers/ - React context providers
  - scripts/ - Database seeding and utility scripts

  Important Files:
  - .env.local - Environment configuration (Supabase keys, etc.)
  - tailwind.config.js - Custom color scheme (grey base, gold accent, red danger)
  - next.config.js - Next.js configuration with typed routes
  - package.json - Dependencies and scripts

  Outstanding Tasks (Todo List)

  1. [CRITICAL] Fix Next.js Development Server
    - Status: In Progress
    - Priority: High
    - Issues: 500 errors, missing JS chunks, server not responding
  2. [PENDING] Implement comprehensive audit logging (Phase 6.1)
    - Status: Pending
    - Priority: Medium
    - Scope: Log all user actions, data changes, system events
  3. [PENDING] Add note versioning system (Phase 3.3)
    - Status: Pending
    - Priority: Medium
    - Scope: Track changes to clinical notes with version history
  4. [PENDING] Create report builder and export functionality (Phase 4.3)
    - Status: Pending
    - Priority: Medium
    - Scope: Custom reports, data export, analytics dashboard

  Key Technical Context

  Authentication System:
  - NextAuth.js configured with Supabase adapter
  - Role-based access control (admin, provider, staff)
  - Session management with JWT tokens

  Database Relations:
  - patients table with risk_level field
  - users table for authentication
  - episodes table for treatment episodes
  - assessments table for PHQ-9, GAD-7, Edinburgh scales
  - clinical_notes table for documentation
  - crisis_events table (needs creation)

  Color Scheme (Updated from gold to grey base):
  - Primary: Grey (#64748b)
  - Accent: Gold (#f59e0b) - Clinica gold, used sparingly
  - Danger: Red (#e53e3e) - For crisis/alerts
  - Success: Green, Warning: Yellow, Info: Blue

  Recent Issues Encountered:
  - TypeScript errors in multiple files (mostly type mismatches)
  - Node.js version compatibility warnings with Supabase client
  - Crisis events table doesn't exist in database yet
  - Development server compilation failures

  User Workflow Context

  Critical Patient Management:
  - Patients like "Ashley Johnson" show as "critical risk"
  - Users need immediate clarity on WHY patients are critical risk
  - Crisis events should be prominently displayed and easily accessible
  - Risk alerts should appear at top of patient pages with clear action buttons

  Crisis Event Documentation:
  - Must specify exact risk type (suicide, violence, etc.)
  - Must document contributing factors for legal compliance
  - Interventions must be tracked with emergency response indicators
  - High/critical events automatically update patient risk levels

  Development Environment

  Current Setup:
  - WSL2 environment
  - Node.js v18.19.1 (needs upgrade to v20+)
  - npm v9.2.0
  - Next.js 14.2.30
  - Working directory: /mnt/c/Users/JarettHall/Programming/Senda_Gemini

  Commands to Run:
  - npm run dev - Start development server
  - npm run build - Build for production
  - npm run seed - Seed database with sample data

  Immediate Action Plan

  1. FIRST: Resolve Next.js server issues
    - Check Node.js version compatibility
    - Clear build cache and reinstall dependencies
    - Fix any TypeScript compilation errors
    - Test with minimal page/layout setup
  2. SECOND: Create crisis_events table in Supabase
    - Run the SQL provided above
    - Test crisis event creation/retrieval
    - Verify Ashley Johnson's critical status displays properly
  3. THIRD: Continue with audit logging implementation (Phase 6.1)

  Files Requiring Attention

  Modified Recently (may need review):
  - src/app/page.tsx - Simplified for debugging
  - src/app/layout.tsx - Simplified for debugging
  - All crisis management components and pages

  Known Issues (TypeScript errors):
  - src/app/page.tsx - useAuth hook property mismatch
  - Multiple components with icon import issues
  - Patient form type mismatches

  The previous developer successfully implemented the crisis management system with comprehensive risk documentation but encountered server startup issues that prevent testing the new features. The crisis
   system is code-complete but needs the database table created and server issues resolved to be functional.
